This page shares issues that users have run into and how they were resolved. Hopefully this will help to solves issues for others.

## Vehicle Control

**Vehicle turns or moves even when not controlled to do so.**

Please check RCx_TRIM parameters to make sure that all trims are set to 1500.

**Motors spin fast as soon as the vehicle is armed.**

First, check to make sure that the joystick throttle is set to "Full down is zero throttle". If that does not fix it, check that the vehicle is calibrated level properly.
